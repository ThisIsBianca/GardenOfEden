# GardenOfEden
EDEN is a modern day interpretation of a Renaissance painting whose subject revolves around creationism. Behind the design of Eden stands the Heesch Kienzle theory about tessellation. Two types of tessellations have been used and combined: C3C3C6C6 and CC3C3.The tessellations have been programmed in Processing with the Oogway library (https://github.com/iddi/oogway). The patterns have been cut into MDF with a laser cutter. More about Eden can be found here: https://www.irinabiancaserban.com/eden
