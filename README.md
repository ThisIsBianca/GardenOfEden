# GardenOfEden
EDEN is a modern day interpretation of a Renaissance painting whose subject revolves around creationism. Behind the design of Eden stands the Heesch Kienzle theory[2] about tessellation. Two types of tessellations have been used and combined: C3C3C6C6 and CC3C3.The tessellations have been programmed in Processing with the Oogway library[1]. The patterns have been cut into MDF with a laser cutter.
